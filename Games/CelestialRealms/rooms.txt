Cloud Capped Range of Mount Pire
You wake up in the heart of “The Celestial Realms”, a medieval world. Mount Pire, a towering giant cloaked in myths and mist. Its base, encircled by dense, whispering forests, is home to creatures of legend and lore. As one ascends, the trees give way to rugged cliffs, where eagles nest and the wind carries ancient tales. The summit, often veiled in clouds, is said to be the dwelling of spirits, guarding sacred relics and secrets of the old world. Knights and pilgrims alike venture its treacherous paths, seeking wisdom, glory, or penance. Such glory is undistinguished to your tired eyes, for Mount Pire is your home, and you, its poor overlooked old man, who lives on the fringes of society, with clothes tattered and worn bearing the marks of countless repairs and the wear of time. For all the world’s misfortunes that have taken place, the times are about to change for the better.

The Glistening Archen River
You enter a uniquely carved Dugout boat traveling down the Archen river, flowing gracefully at the base of Mount Pire. This serene ribbon of crystal-clear water, is one of the Realm’s most beautiful treasures. One finds peace traversing its waters. To you, it's your escape from reality and pathway to your favourite spot in all the land.

Master Oogways Cherry Tree
You reach the valley beyond the Archen River. There stands a magnificent cherry tree, a solitary sentinel in the lush landscape. Its leaves, a deep, rich green, rustle softly, adding to the tree's serene presence. You lay at its deep roots, where you take a nap, and take in the fresh air while a gentle breeze caresses your grimy, smudged face. Hours later you find yourself disturbed by a thundering noise, while the ground below you rattles. You stand in a hurry, and in the distance, in the Dancing Lawn, you spot an orc army. Soldiers of the dark Witch herself, spreading like a plague, spreading fire and ruin to everything in their path. You must act quick, or perish yourself.

The Forever Frozen Waterfall
A wise choice heading north, to the land of unforgiving cold. A frozen waterfall stands as a stunning natural sculpture. Cascading icicles glisten like diamonds in the sunlight, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. The once-rushing water is now a serene, crystal blue curtain, frozen mid-descent, capturing the beauty and stillness of the winter landscape around it. You know you cannot stay for long, before freezing to death, you must find shelter.

The Old Mans Winter Home
You wander further into the frozen lands, a land blanketed by snow. Your breath, fogging, taking in the cold air, freezing your lungs. As you expect this to be your last moment in the world of the living, you see an old man's cabin, a humble abode seemingly carved from the winter itself. The small, wooden structure, with its weathered walls and snow-laden roof, blends seamlessly into the icy landscape. Smoke gently curls from its stone chimney, hinting at the warmth within. You make your way towards survival, but collapse in the thick field of glistening snow. You suddenly wake up, walls around you, a sizzling fire in a large stone fireplace, and there in front of you stands an old man, hands held out with a cup of coffee. You grab the coffee with no hesitation, and gulp it down in one go. After a speedy recovery you explain to the man what you have seen. Worried, the old man convinces you to help him take a stand against the Witch’s plan of taking over the realm. You agree to his plan.

Cauldron Pool
You continue down a dark path, to the Cauldron Pool, a place steeped in malevolence. Surrounded by jagged rocks and gnarled, leafless trees, the pool emits an eerie, sulfurous mist that clings to the ground. You see a small town of goblins. Keeping out of sight, you wait for an opening to go around them. As you step back, *CRACK*, you snap a twig due to your unhealthy weight. Goblins, having enhanced hearing abilities, spot you. As lovers of gold, they believe you are trying to steal it and charge after you. With nothing but your rusty iron sword, and the training of the old man, the two of you kill every single goblin. Celebrating your victory, a goblin troll goes unnoticed, coming up behind you. With one swing, it sweeps you off your feet. Badly injured, you struggle to get up. But the will to live was strong in you, and together you battle the goblin troll.

You and the old man stop by the local pub where you eat to your heart's desire. You thank the chef and make your way. Suddenly, you come to the realization that you still look like a homeless peasant who has been forgotten to the hands of time. You wander down to the market where you browse the different hand crafted outfits that the villagers have to offer.

You approach the hut, and knock on its rotting door. The door creaks open, and on the other side you are greeted by a wizard. He welcomes you into his home. You scan your surroundings, coming to the conclusion that even you were living in better conditions at the top of Mount Pire. There was also a remarkably large collection of potions stacked on the shelfs that lined his walls. You ask him who he is. He introduces himself as Mr. Tumnus, a potion wizard, who can make anything a reality with the power of his potions.

Whilst spears are pressed against your back, they ask what brings you to this part of the world. The old man explains his plan to free the world of the Witch’s hold. They bring you, blindfolded, to their secret base, where you seek an audience with their leader. You fight to seek an alliance with the rebellion in order to defeat the Witch Queen.

Blood, bodies, spears of both sides filled the ground. A brutal battle had taken place, one in which the Witch’s armies were triumphant . You walk through the field looking for any survivors. Suddenly a man grabs your leg. You shriek, and reach for your weapon. The old man stops you before slaying the man out of panic. In his dying breath, the wounded soldier whispers “the end is here, run, save yourselves”.

You continue walking looking for more allies in your battle against the evil Witch Queen. You come across a campsite. Large tents stacked beside each other. You wander into the encampment and are halted by the soldiers. Knights of the kingdom of Anvard. They bring you handcuffed to the larger of the tents. You walk inside to reveal the most luxurious of atmospheres. Was this a tent, or the palace of the fallen kings? Further in, a man introduces himself. Standing 6 feet tall, muscles larger than that of a lion, golden blonde hair. “I am prince Arthur of Anvard, state your business, or die to my hand”. Before that could happen, we quickly stated our mission, and asked for their assistance. Intrigued that a simple middle aged peasant along with an old man were on such a quest, he offered a helping hand. You stay the night, finally able to sleep in a proper bed with the more delicious feast of boar meat, and the finest of cheese.

With all the experience you have gained, you charge forwards without a drop of fear in your heart. You pick up a knife from a fallen warrior and use it to blind the cyclops. You then proceed to cut their calves, causing them to fall to the ground, from which you finish them off. Cyclops travel in packs, but there is always the leader. A gray beast twice the size of all the others, with bloodshot eyes, and veins popping from his impressive muscles. Without a second doubt you leap towards the cyclops. Two hours later, bones about to give in to your weakening state, you are still battling the cyclops leader. He knocks you down. Kicks you forward, your body scraping against the stone hard ground. He walks towards you, ready to finish you off. The old man begins a flank, ready to cut the beast at the legs. As he swings his sword, the cyclops with an incredible reaction time and awareness of his surroundings, turns and grabs the old man. He lifts him up and proceeds to squeeze the life out of him. Before you could save him, his bones break, and he suffocates to death. You scream in pain, beginning to cry, for he was your mentor, the man that gave purpose to your life, the person you’d been traveling with for the better part of a year. You continue to fight to avenge your friend’s death, but struggle. You then remember a potion that you received from a wizard long ago. You throw it at the beast, and he begins to sizzle, burning from the sun’s golden light. He diminishes in front of you. Finally victorious against the monster, you mourn the death of the old man, and give him a proper burial.

Galma was a melting pot of cultures, a place where adventure and opportunity beckon at every corner. But now, it has turned into a graveyard, in which the mighty Basilisk has claimed as its home. You see the mighty warhammer in the distance, and circling it is the giant snake. You see an opening and run towards the hammer, gently placed on a pedestal. As you grab for it, the Basilisk snaps, almost biting your arm off. You step back with haste, almost falling over. You take out your sword and prepare to fight for the Warhammer of the king of Cair Paravel.

You seek an audience with the king, at which you ask for his assistance. He speaks of a weapon of great power, lying east of his kingdom. A hammer not even the mighty Thor could hold. He offered this to you, on one condition. You must defeat the Basilisk that protects the land like a dragon does its gold. The very name itself strikes fear in your eyes, but what choice do you have?
